QUADStor storage virtualization installation guide

Prerequistes
------------

On FreeBSD 8.x/9.x:

pkg_add -r sudo apache22 gmake 
Additionally the kernel source /usr/sys/sys needs to be present

On RHEL/CentOS 5.x/6.x:

yum install httpd gcc perl kernel-devel sg3_utils

On SLES 11 SP1/SP2:

zypper install apache2 gcc perl kernel-default-devel sg3_utils

On Debian 6.x/7.x:

apt-get install uuid-runtime
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install sg3-utils
apt-get install apache2
apt-get install psmisc
apt-get install firmware-qlogic (for FC access)
apt-get install linux-headers-{uname}
where {uname} can be got from the command 'uname -r'

If you have installed any of the release packages before, then you most likely have all the prerequistes installed.

Installation
------------

Login to the machine where quadstor needs to be installed. Download the source using git

git clone --branch opensource https://github.com/quadstor/quadstorvirt.git quadstor

You could also download the source from https://github.com/quadstor/quadstorvirt (Download ZIP button on the right)
 
cd quadstor (or the directory which gets unpacked)

On RHEL/CentOS 6.x (x86_64):
./installworld rhel6

On Debian 7.x/Wheezy:
./installworld debian7

On Debian 6.x/Squeeze:
./installworld debian6

On SLES 11 SP2:
./installworld sles11sp2

On FreeBSD 9.x
./installworld bsd9

On FreeBSD 8.x
./installworld bsd

For other distributions, choose the method closest from the above. For example for FC19 ./installworld rhel6 should work

Post Installation
-----------------
One Linux

By default quadstor services are automatically started during system startup.If you wish to start the service manually then run the following command

sh# /sbin/chkconfig --del quadstor

To start the service manually

sh# /etc/rc.d/init.d/quadstor start (On RHEL/CentOS)
sh# /etc/init.d/quadstor start (On SLES, Debian)

To stop the service

sh# /etc/rc.d/init.d/quadstor stop (On RHEL/CentOS)
sh# /etc/init.d/quadstor stop (On SLES, Debian)

If the system already has other iscsi target software services running, ensure that they are not started on system startup and while starting the quadstor service
NOTE: After an install and if a reboot was not initiated you will need to manually start the quadstor service. However if after the install the system was rebooted quadstor service would have started automatically
SELinux Considerations

While the package installation and quadstor start script takes care of on SELinux enabled environment the following need to be done if you have SELinux enabled

/usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_enable_cgi 1
/usr/sbin/semanage permissive -a httpd_t

On RHEL/CentOS 6.x you need to install policycoreutils-python package (yum install policycoreutils-python) to install semanage utility
Fibre Channel driver installation

The necessary steps required for fibre channel driver installation are taken care of. Unless the kernel version needs to be change no additional steps are required. On a kernel upgrade or after booting to a new kernel version, ensure that installworld is runagain
NOTE: A reboot is required to load the new FC driver if LUNs are to be accessed via the FC interface

On FreeBSD:

Add the following to /etc/rc.conf

quadstor_enable="YES" 

The above change needs to be done If you wish to start the quadstor service automatically on system boot. If you wish to start the service manually run /etc/rc.d/quadstor onestart and to stop the service /etc/rc.d/quadstor onestop
Fibre Channel Installation

Add the following to /boot/loader.conf in the same order as below

ispfw_load="YES"
ispmod_load="YES"
remove isp_load="YES" if present

The ispmod driver used is a modified version of the FreeBSD isp driver but all device hints suggested in the manpage of isp are supported. Also the current behavior of the driver is to enable both target mode and initiator mode. Initiator mode is required, if for access to disks or tape is over fiber channel connected to QLogic cards. If however you are accessing disks or tape without the need for FC connected to QLogic card(s) then it is suggested to disable initiator mode. This can be change by adding a device hint in either the /boot/loader.conf or /boot/device.hints.

For example:
hint.ispmod.0.role="1" would enable target mode only. Note that ispmod.0 specifies the first QLogic adapter, ispmod.1 the second etc.
role can be "1" [target mode only], "2" [ initiator mode only], "3" [both target and initiator mode]
A reboot is required to load the new FC driver if LUNs are to be accessed via the FC interface

Uninstallation
--------------

Go back to the location where the sources were built and run

./uninstallworld

uninstallworld removes most of the installed files except for custom configurationf files like /quadstor/etc/quadstor.conf and the postgresql database data files under /quadstor/pgsql/data. These will have to be manually removed if you are clearing out an installation.
/quadstor/pgdata contains the configuration database of the software. This data is maintained even after an uninstall of the software and is required for upgrades. If this data were to manually removed all previous configuration such as configured storage, VDisks is lost. Refer to http://www.quadstor.com/support/131-recovering-from-a-lost-or-damaged-database.html to recover from a lost or damage database
